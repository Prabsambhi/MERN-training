// -> What is a state

   In React.js, state is like a way to keep track of things that can change in a component.
   Each part of your app can have its own state, and whenever the state of a component changes,
   the component re-renders to reflect these changes.

// -> Hooks ( useState, useEffect, useRef and many more .... )

   Hooks are special functions in React that let you use react features in functional components.

// -> useState hook

   Explain with examples


const [count, setCount]=(useState(5)); 

a variable (count=5) & a function (setCount)



// -> Props

   Props (shortform for properties) are a way to pass data from one component to another in React. 
   Props allow components to be dynamic and reusable by allowing them to receive different
   data and behave accordingly.
